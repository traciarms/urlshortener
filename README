cd into the urlshortener directory run the following commands:
./manage.py makemigrations
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py runserver




The Performance design considerations:

I designed this URL shortener to be a giant hash table where a 6 character
sequence of random alpha-numeric characters are generated and used for the
shortened URL and is used to look up the full URL in the hash table.

This 6 character sequence is guaranteed to be unique.  I required this as an
optimization so that there doesn't need to be further decoding in the full
URL lookup process.

Another concern for performance is that the data is never deleted - this
feature could be added to the user interface (once the accounts are created)
and the user could view their shortened urls and delete old ones if necessary.
It could also be added as an asynchronous task in order to maintain the data.
Or another option for data purge could be a date expiration since we are
storing the date they were created.

Another optimization could be to add in a filter into the code for malicious
or bogus urls instead of just generating the short_id and storing them.  This
will eliminate unneeded cluttering of the database
