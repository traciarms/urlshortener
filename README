I designed this URL shortener to be a giant hash table where 6 character sequence of
random characters is used for the short URL and is used to look up the full URL.

This 6 character sequence is gauranteed to be unique.  I required this as an
optimization so that there doesn't need to be further decoding in the lookup
process.
